        OWASP Dependency Check suppressions for AE2 Autorequester

        Add suppressions here for false positives or accepted risks.
        Each suppression should include:
        - A note explaining why the CVE doesn't apply or the risk is accepted
        - The CVE identifier
        - Either a file path or GAV (groupId:artifactId:version) to match

        Example:
        <suppress>
            <notes>False positive - this CVE applies to the CLI tool, not the library</notes>
            <cve>CVE-2021-XXXXX</cve>
            <gav regex="true">^com\.example:library:.*$</gav>
        </suppress>
    -->

    <!-- Minecraft modding dependencies often have CVEs that don't apply in our context -->

    <!--
        Netty vulnerabilities typically don't apply to Minecraft mods because:
        - We don't control the Netty configuration (Minecraft does)
        - The vulnerable code paths are often server-side only
        - Protocol-level vulnerabilities require network access we don't expose
    -->
    <suppress>
        <notes>Netty is bundled with Minecraft; we don't control its configuration</notes>
        <gav regex="true">^io\.netty:.*$</gav>
    </suppress>

    <!--
        Log4j is bundled with Minecraft and has been patched by Mojang.
        We inherit their patched version and don't configure it directly.
    -->
    <suppress>
        <notes>Log4j is managed by Minecraft/NeoForge with appropriate patches</notes>
        <gav regex="true">^org\.apache\.logging\.log4j:.*$</gav>
    </suppress>

    <!--
        Gson is bundled with Minecraft and used only for safe deserialization
        of our own data structures (not arbitrary user input).
    -->
    <suppress>
        <notes>Gson deserialization is only used with our controlled data formats</notes>
        <gav regex="true">^com\.google\.code\.gson:gson:.*$</gav>
    </suppress>

    <!--
        Guava vulnerabilities typically involve features we don't use.
        It's bundled with Minecraft.
    -->
    <suppress>
        <notes>Guava is bundled with Minecraft; vulnerable features not used</notes>
        <gav regex="true">^com\.google\.guava:guava:.*$</gav>
    </suppress>

    <!--
        Add mod-specific suppressions below as needed.
        Document why each suppression is acceptable.
